			<h2>IGN</h2>
			<div class="col10">
			<p>I finished my first playthrough of Undertale in stunned silence. My journey had begun with dumb puns and silly puzzles, but the end affected me in a way I never expected. That’s kind of Undertale’s specialty — playing with our expectations of what an RPG should be, subverting them, and using them to drive a story unique to what games can do. Its strong writing, integration of gameplay with storytelling, and acute understanding of its audience all build to something that surprises at every turn.<br>

			<h2>GameSpot</h2>
			<div class="col10">
			<p>While it seems to be a game that's designed for RPG fans first and foremost, a lot of Undertale's jokes have universal appeal. A pair of comically incompetent skeletons regularly spout puns and jokes while attempting
			and failing to halt your progress, and the social ineptitude exhibited by one character when they try to express their feelings for another is a regular source of laughter.<br>

				<h2>Destructoid</h2>
				<div class="col10">
				<p>Asking me to review Undertale on PlayStation 4 is sort of like asking me to review sex. Even when it’s “bad” it’s still incredible, and the extremely brisk pace and short length (there’s a joke here I’m sure) of the game means that if you hit a puzzle or gap you don’t really enjoy, it will be over quickly enough that it shouldn’t bother you.<br>

				<h2>Common Sense Media</h2>
				<div class="col10">
				<p>Parents need to know that Undertale is a downloadable role-playing game designed to be an entree into the genre. Cleverly, it emphasizes understanding that the old trappings of violence and beating up enemies without real cause can be totally ignored or considered a last resort. You have no cause to hurt anyone, and when you realize that as you get deeper into the game, it drastically changes the way you approach the environment and even listen to the characters. It's a way of rethinking the familiar, then pondering the other possibilities.<br>
