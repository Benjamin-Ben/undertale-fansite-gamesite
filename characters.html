			<p>Sans is laid back, often sleeping on the job and taking breaks. His laziness is a combination of fatalism and apathy. He wonders if his indolence stems from his knowledge that any progress he makes will be erased when the timeline resets. Conversely, he suggests that this knowledge could be "a poor excuse for being lazy."</p>

			<p>Though Sans is usually agreeable, he becomes eerily serious at particular moments. He is also observant; Sans reads the protagonist's expressions and can often tell when they have already done certain tasks. He enjoys making skeleton-related puns and the fact that he performs at MTT Resort hints that he may be a talented comedian. He enjoys science fiction and loves to drink ketchup. He also hates making promises.</p>

			<p>Sans may have a scientific background. Evidence includes the quantum physics book, workshop, his relationship to Alphys, affinity for science, and his timeline research.</p>

			<p>Oh also, Sans remembers everything, even if you restart the game, or don’t save.</p> 

			<p>He actually also remembers when you have finished the game, restarts it and plays round, he’s very mysterious. Oh, and he’s also Papyrus’ brother.</p>  

			<p>There’s a lot we don’t know about Sans, even after finishing the game.</p>

			<p>Papyrus is a tall, perhaps anatomically inaccurate skeleton with a skull more vertical and geometric than his brother. Being skeletal, many of his expressions incorporate a toothy grin. His eyes resemble vertical slits; his skeletal pseudo-brows form most of his expressions. He has eyeballs which show at times when he is experiencing strong emotions.</p>

			<p>He wears his "battle body," an outfit that he created for a costume party. It includes a white chest plate with gold trim, orange-red gloves with gold trim, blue briefs with a golden belt, and knee-high, orange-red boots. A symbol that resembles that of Starman from the MOTHER series adorns the chest plate. He also wears a short orange-red cape.</p>

		<p>Undyne is passionate about everything that she does. She acts quickly on her ideas and is steadfast in her beliefs. Though she wants to defeat the protagonist, she also tries to be fair and offers an explanation of how Green Mode works. Asgore taught her the value of pacifism, which is why Undyne sees the protagonist as "a wimpy loser with a big heart." When the protagonist first encounters her, she fights to further Asgore's plan of collecting seven human SOULs but, if the protagonist shows mercy, Undyne just as quickly defends them from Asgore.</p>

		<p>She loves to help others and mentors Shyren and Papyrus in various skills. Undyne dislikes puzzles, loves japes,[4] and enjoys anime, an affinity she shares with her romantic interest, Alphys. Since Alphys told Undyne that anime is actually human history, Undyne regards human history as exciting and cool.</p>

		<p>Out of all encountered monsters, Undyne possesses the most Determination. She melts before her death, implying that her body cannot handle the amount of Determination she has.</p>

		<p>Toriel is a kind monster that acts as a protective mother for the protagonist. She employs tough love on the protagonist as well as Asgore. She cares for children and was excited to become a mother.</p>

		<p>She enjoys cooking and bakes butterscotch-cinnamon pie as well as her favorite, snail pie.</p>

		<p>Toriel has a playful side and loves puns and bad jokes and she even keeps a journal of puns.</p>

		<p>Toriel is said to be intelligent and dreams of becoming a teacher. She has already prepared a curriculum for the protagonist by the time they reach her home in the Ruins. In the True Pacifist Ending Credits, she stands outside a school and, in the Family Ending of a Neutral Route, she starts her own.</p>

Like his son, he speaks in southern slang (most notably "howdy" and "golly").

Though he is miserable <span class="asgore-Soul">because he has killed humans,</span> he feels that it is his duty to his people to battle the protagonist.</p>
